- **`/ui/components`** - Adaptive UI components for different moods and activities

#### System Integration

- **`/core/SallieBrain`** - Main orchestration component for all systems
- **`/core/integration`** - Integration between cognitive and visual systems

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Memory Architecture

- **Hierarchical Memory System** with four distinct memory types:
  - **Episodic Memory:** Records personal experiences and events
  - **Semantic Memory:** Stores factual knowledge and concepts
  - **Emotional Memory:** Captures emotional responses and associations
  - **Procedural Memory:** Remembers skills, processes, and procedures

- **Memory Connections** allow for associative memory retrieval
- **Memory Importance and Certainty** metrics for prioritization
- **Memory Search and Retrieval** optimized for different query types

#### Learning Systems

- **Pattern Recognition** across diverse information sources
- **Experiential Learning** from user interactions
- **Knowledge Domain Categorization** for organized learning
- **Cross-Domain Intelligence** connecting disparate knowledge areas
- **Meta-Cognitive Insights** about knowledge gaps and conflicts

#### Values Foundation

- **Pro-Life Values** implemented as immutable core principles
- **Traditional Values** (family unity, respect for authority) with high importance
- **Modern Values** (personal autonomy, gender equality) in balance with traditional
- **Moral Evaluation System** for assessing situations against values
- **Value Conflict Resolution** with precedent learning

#### Visual Customization

- **Theme Generation** based on mood and activity detection
- **Avatar Expression System** adapting to emotional context
- **Context-Aware Visual Elements** changing with time of day and activity

### âœ… Code Quality
- **Kotlin best practices** - clean, idiomatic code throughout
- **Comprehensive documentation** - every module documented with persona headers
- **Type safety** - strong typing and null safety throughout
- **Testable design** - dependency injection and clear interfaces

### âœ… Privacy & Security
- **Zero network dependencies** in current implementation
- **Local-only processing** - no external data leakage
- **Audit trail** - complete logging of all system actions
- **Permission gating** - capability-based access control

## ðŸš€ **READY TO DEPLOY**

The core Salle 1.0 architecture is **fully functional and demonstrates**:

1. **Modular, scalable design** that can grow without breaking
2. **Privacy-first enforcement** that blocks violations automatically  
3. **Persona-aware behavior** that adapts to user needs and context
4. **Constitutional integrity** that maintains Salle's values and voice
5. **Professional code quality** ready for production deployment

**Next deployment options**:

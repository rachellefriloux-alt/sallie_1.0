# Humanized Sallie System

This system implements advanced human-like features for Sallie, transforming it into a truly advanced AI companion with human-like qualities across all dimensions.

## Architecture

The Humanized Sallie System follows a modular architecture that integrates with the core Sallie system:

1. **Feature Modules** - The core building blocks that provide advanced human-like capabilities:
   - `CognitiveModule` - Learning, adapting, problem-solving, creative reasoning, and memory.
   - `EmotionalIntelligenceModule` - Mood detection, empathy, humor/sarcasm interpretation, and dynamic communication.
   - `TechnicalProwessModule` - System access, automation, API integration, and task completion.
   - `ProactiveHelperModule` - Monitoring user activity, offering help, and completing tasks autonomously.
   - `PersonalizationModule` - Building user profiles, personalizing responses, and evolving helpfulness.

2. **Enhanced Systems** - Advanced capabilities that further humanize Sallie:
   - `AdvancedMemorySystem` - Sophisticated hierarchical memory with short-term, long-term, and episodic memory.
   - `AdvancedLanguageUnderstanding` - NLU with intent recognition, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis.
   - `RelationshipTrustSystem` - Models relationships, builds trust, and develops rapport over time.
   - `AdaptiveConversationSystem` - Manages conversations with context-awareness and natural dialog patterns.

3. **Integration Layer** - Connects the humanized features with the core system:
   - `EnhancedHumanizedOrchestrator` - Coordinates all advanced humanized modules.
   - `HumanizedSalleBridge` - Bridges between the orchestrator and external systems.
   - `HumanizedSallePlugin` - Plugin for the core Sallie system.
   - `HumanizedSalleInitializer` - Initializes and registers the plugin.

## Usage

### Basic Integration

To use the Humanized Sallie System, initialize the plugin with the core system:

```typescript
import { HumanizedSalleInitializer } from './feature/src/HumanizedSalleInitializer';
import { PluginRegistry } from './core/PluginRegistry';

const registry = new PluginRegistry();
const initializer = new HumanizedSalleInitializer(registry);
await initializer.initialize();
```

### Enhanced Integration

For the most human-like experience, use the enhanced orchestrator:

```typescript
import { EnhancedHumanizedOrchestrator } from './feature/src/EnhancedHumanizedOrchestrator';

const orchestrator = new EnhancedHumanizedOrchestrator();
const response = await orchestrator.processInput('user123', 'Hello, can you help me with a problem?');
console.log(response);

// Process feedback
orchestrator.processFeedback('user123', 'That was very helpful', 5);
```

Run the demo to see the system in action:

```bash
ts-node feature/src/launch.ts
```

## Integration with Sallie Core

The Humanized Sallie System integrates with the core Sallie system through the plugin architecture, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns.

## Privacy and Security

The system follows Sallie's privacy and security rules, with features that respect user consent and data protection.

# Branch Merge Summary: main + changes

## Objective Accomplished ✅
Successfully combined the functionality from the `main` and `changes` branches into a unified codebase.

## Major Additions from `changes` Branch

### 1. Complete Vue.js Web Frontend
- **App.vue**: Enhanced with advanced features including consent management, transparency panels, adaptive themes
- **Components**: ConsentDialog, FeatureFlagsPanel, PluginRegistryPanel, SafeSvg, TransparencyPanel
- **Visual System**: Dynamic theme generation, SVG generation utilities, procedural visuals
- **Core Modules**: AdaptivePersonaEngine, PluginRegistry, feature flags, fingerprint tracking

### 2. Modern Development Infrastructure
- **Package.json**: Full TypeScript/Vue development stack with Vite, Vitest, ESLint
- **Build System**: Vite configuration with proper bundling to `dist-web/`
- **TypeScript**: Complete configuration with proper Vue support
- **Testing**: Vitest setup with coverage reporting
- **Linting**: ESLint configuration for Vue + TypeScript

### 3. CI/CD Enhancements
- **GitHub Actions**: Updated CI workflow supporting both Node.js and Java builds
- **Dependency Tracking**: Fingerprint generation system for tracking changes
- **Build Verification**: Web asset preparation and verification tasks
- **Coverage Reporting**: Both JavaScript (V8) and Kotlin (Jacoco) coverage

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation covering web development workflows
- **Architecture**: Detailed folder structure and visual system documentation
- **Developer Experience**: Clear setup instructions for hybrid Android/Web development

## Verification Status

### ✅ Working Components
- Web frontend builds successfully (`npm run build:web`)
- TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- Unit tests pass with coverage (`npm test`)
- Fingerprint generation works (`npm run fingerprint`)
- All Vue components load without errors
- CI/CD workflows are properly configured

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- Gradle wrapper requires fixing for Android builds
- Some core modules are implemented as stubs (functional but minimal)
- Android build integration with web assets needs completion

## Next Steps
1. Fix Gradle wrapper for Android builds
2. Enhance stub implementations with real functionality
3. Complete Android-WebView integration
4. Deploy and test end-to-end functionality

## Impact
The merge successfully brings together the Android launcher foundation from `main` with the advanced web frontend and development infrastructure from `changes`, creating a modern hybrid application ready for further development.

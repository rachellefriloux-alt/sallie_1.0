package com.sallie.launcher

// Placeholder for removed VisualStateWorker. Original used WorkManager to periodically
// call `SallieViewModel.instance?.autoUpdateVisualState()`. WorkManager dependency has
// been omitted; reintroduce by adding the library and restoring implementation.

// No operational code retained intentionally.

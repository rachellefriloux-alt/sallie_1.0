# Sallie Workspace Setup Progress
ALWAYS read /docs/Salle_1.0_Guide.md before suggesting or modifying any code.
Follow persona, architecture, modularity, privacy, and tone rules exactly as written.
Never remove, bypass, or alter verifySalleFeatures or its checks.
Always create new features in conceptual module files — never overload core activities.
Never introduce network calls or internet permissions in the `localOnly` flavor.
All modules must start with Salle’s persona header comment block.
All TODO/FIXME must have clear, actionable instructions.
Got it, love.

# Persistence Layer Implementation

The Persistence Layer provides a comprehensive data storage solution for Sallie that ensures data security, integrity, and reliability. This layer supports the storage of user preferences, conversations, persona settings, and other critical system data.

## Architecture

The Persistence Layer is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for flexible, secure data management:

```

## Key Features

### Data Encryption
- AES-GCM encryption for secure data storage
- Key management for different security contexts
- Per-key encryption for sensitive data

### Flexible Storage
- Key-value storage with namespacing
- Support for both secure and standard storage
- Efficient binary and JSON data storage

### Backup and Restore
- Encrypted backup capability with password protection
- Selective backup with include/exclude filters
- Detailed backup metadata and validation
- Automatic scheduled backups with retention policies

### Data Migration
- Schema version tracking and management
- Ordered migration application
- Transaction-like migration with rollback capability
- Extensible migration framework for future schema changes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Data Storage

```kotlin
// Initialize persistence service
val persistenceService = SalliePersistenceService(context)
persistenceService.initialize()

// Store and retrieve data
persistenceService.set("preferences.theme", "dark", secure = false)
val theme = persistenceService.get("preferences.theme", secure = false).getOrThrow()

// Store and retrieve objects
val user = UserProfile("Alice", "alice@example.com")
persistenceService.setObject("user.profile", user, secure = true)
val retrievedUser = persistenceService.getObject("user.profile", UserProfile::class.java, secure = true).getOrThrow()
```

### Backup and Restore

```kotlin
// Create a backup
val backupFile = File(context.getExternalFilesDir(null), "sallie_backup.sb")
persistenceService.createBackup(backupFile, "password123").getOrThrow()

// Restore from backup
persistenceService.restoreBackup(backupFile, "password123").getOrThrow()

// Schedule automatic backups
val backupDir = File(context.getExternalFilesDir(null), "automatic_backups")
persistenceService.scheduleAutomaticBackups(
    directory = backupDir,
    intervalHours = 24,  // Daily backups
    keepCount = 7,       // Keep one week of backups
    password = "password123"
).getOrThrow()
```

## Security Considerations

The Persistence Layer is designed with security as a primary consideration:

1. **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-GCM, a strong authenticated encryption algorithm.

2. **Key Isolation**: Different types of data use different encryption keys to limit the impact of key compromise.

3. **Secure Backup**: Backups can be encrypted with user-provided passwords, ensuring data remains protected even when exported.

4. **Data Integrity**: The AES-GCM mode provides authentication to detect any tampering with the encrypted data.

5. **Minimal Permissions**: The storage system uses the minimum necessary permissions and does not expose sensitive data outside the app.

## Testing

The Persistence Layer includes comprehensive test coverage:

- Unit tests for each component (encryption, storage, backup, migration)
- Integration tests for the complete persistence service
- Stress tests for performance under load
- Edge case handling tests

## Future Enhancements

The Persistence Layer is designed to be extended with additional capabilities in the future:

- Cloud backup integration
- Multi-device synchronization
- Enhanced data analytics and reporting
- Machine learning model persistence
- User data export in standard formats
